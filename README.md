# Welcome to Telephone!

This React Native application takes the childhood classic game of micommunication and adds a sketching twist. Players alternate between sketching and describing the previous sketch, creating an unexpected and humorous story along the way. 

## Technology Used

The application is developed with a Ruby on Rails [backend](https://github.com/kel29/Telephone-server), S3 image hosting, and a React Native with Expo frontend. User authentication is integrated with Facebook login. Touch drawing is implemented with Expo-Pixi and user interface is enhanced with Native Base.
